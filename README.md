# Component Life Cycle Phases

Every React Component goes through three phases throughout its lifetime:

1. Mounting Phase
3. Updating Phase
4. Unmounting phase

# Mounting Phase
1. constructor()
2. render()
3. componentDidMount()

# Updating Phase
1. render()

# Unmounting phase
1. componentWillUnmount()
